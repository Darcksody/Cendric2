| Day 212, 1103
| My dear Elona has still not returned. It's unusual for her to stay in the Stone Garden for such a long time. Maybe she found a new place where rare herbs grow?
|-
| Day 214, 1103
| I'm worried, even though she's a good mage and can defend herself. I won't wait any longer.

Tomorrow, I'll start searching for her.
|-
| Day 218, 1103
| I still can't believe that my beloved Elona is gone. I've found pieces of her broken staff in the Stone Garden and tried to reassemble them, but it's not complete. 

I can't entomb her traditionally with her staff, but only with a part of it. I'm going to keep the magic stone from the staff here, in memory of her.
