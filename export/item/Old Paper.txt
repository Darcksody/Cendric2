| Antigravity
| Gravity is merely a form of elemental (earth) magic. Using its inversed form in an area will weaken it, making objects appear lighter.

If enough anti-energy is used, objects will levitate. Using even more, objects will be lifted into the sky. 

Using it on a human should be avoided outside and should only be practised in buildings with a strong roof.
