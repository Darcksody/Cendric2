'DL_Zeff_IAmWhat', '(Growls quietly) I see, my outer appearance is striking.', ''
'DL_Zeff_IAmSuprised', 'I''m suprised you have the courage to talk to me. Most people I meet flee in terror when they see my face.', ''
'DL_Choice_YouLookNice', 'I don''t think you look terrifying.', ''
'DL_Choice_YouLookTerrible', 'That''s not suprising. You truly look scary.', ''
'DL_Choice_IAmNotAfraid', 'I''m not afraid of you.', ''
'DL_Zeff_ThankYouLooks', 'Thank you. You''re the first person to say something nice since I was turned into this monster.', ''
'DL_Zeff_IAmScary', '(Hangs his head) Yes I do. I really wish I wouldn''t have been turned in such a monster.', ''
'DL_Zeff_YouShouldBe', 'Maybe you should be. My mind is still human, but I feel that it will also be turned into the one of a monster soon.', ''
'DL_Choice_WhyMonster', 'Why were you turned into... this?', ''
'DL_Choice_Werewolf', 'Are you a werewolf?', ''

'DL_Choice_LivedInGandria', 'You were a citizen of Gandria?', ''
'DL_Choice_Sheep', 'There went a few sheep missing...', ''
'DL_Zeff_HelpCurse', 'Maybe. If you are brave enough, you can go and try to kill that thing. Killing the creator of a curse will break it in most cases.', ''
'DL_Zeff_HelpCurse2', 'The cave where it hides is right outside of the city. But be cautious and don''t let it stare into your eyes.', ''
'DL_Zeff_CurseStronger', 'Yes. In the beginning, this fur grew and shortly after that, I got wolf ears and eyes. Then this magnificent tail popped out and now I''m wondering for how long I can still walk on two legs.', ''

'DL_Zeff_Hunting3', 'Then this... thing appeared. I couldn''t see much, because it was dark in there, but it was huge. One glowing eye, staring at me... The next thing I remember is waking up at the entry of the cave, covered in fur.', ''
'DL_Zeff_LivedGandria', 'Yes, I was. I had a beautiful little leather workshop in Gandria. (Sobs) But it seems like I''ll never see it again.', ''

'DL_Choice_Sorry', 'I''m so sorry for you.', ''

'DL_Choice_IGotMeat', 'I got some meat for you. I hope that''s enough.', ''
'DL_Zeff_YouSuspect', 'Yes... yes... and now, only because I look like a wolf, I''m your first suspect.', ''
'DL_Zeff_YoureRight', 'Well, to be honest, you''re totally right. I was the one who stole the sheep. But I can''t just walk into the tavern and buy some meat, can I?', ''
'DL_Choice_BadassSword', 'You have a badass sword, killing sheep is just low.', ''
'DL_Zeff_ComeAndTry', 'That''s the last mistake you''ll ever make.', ''

'DL_Choice_MyCurse', 'I got cursed too, do you know what it is? (Show the mark)', ''
'DL_Zeff_ShowMark', 'Hrr... (Glares at your mark) I''ve never seen something like that.', ''
'DL_Zeff_ShowMark2', 'But I think you got off cheaply... I mean look at my face! Having a fancy tattoo can''t be worse than be forced to kill sheep every night.', ''
'DL_Choice_ItWasYou', 'So it was YOU who stole the sheep from the farmers!', ''
'DL_Choice_YouAreRight', 'Maybe you''re right...', ''
'DL_Choice_MyCurseIsWorse', 'My curse could be worse, I just don''t know.', ''
'DL_Choice_BeastSlain', 'I found the beast that cursed you in the caverns...', ''
'DL_Cendric_BeastSlain', '... It''s dead.', ''
'DL_Zeff_BeastSlain', 'Really? (Stares at his paws) I don''t feel any different.', ''
'DL_Zeff_BeastSlain2', 'The curse didn''t get worse though lately. Maybe the transformation just stopped...', ''
'DL_Choice_StayWolf', 'Yes, it seems like you''ll stay a wolf.', ''
'DL_Choice_ReturnToGandria', 'Will you be able to return to Gandria anyway?', ''
'DL_Zeff_StayWolf', 'I guess so. If my mind keeps clear, I think I can even get to like that form. But when I think about returning home...', ''
'DL_Zeff_ReturningHome', 'I''m afraid, I still can''t get past the guards. Maybe you could try to tell them what happened and convince them to let me in? When I get my workshop back, I''m sure I could craft you a natty hat as a reward.', ''
'DL_Choice_GoHomeZeff', 'I''ve talked to the guards. They''ll let you in.', ''
