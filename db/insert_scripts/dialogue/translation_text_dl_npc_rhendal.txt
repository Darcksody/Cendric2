'DL_Rhendal_IngridSentYou', 'Ah, Ingrid. Our talented cook.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_WhatIsProblem', 'So, what exactly is your problem?', ''
'DL_Cendric_Problem', 'I''ve awoken in the forest in the north and I can''t remember anything. I have no clue who I am and how I got there. My name is Cendric, that''s the only thing I know.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_Eyeballing', 'That''s interesting and worrying at the same time. But you''re in luck, I happen to be initiated in the art of alchemy and I know just the right potion that may help you.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_BringMe', 'I have most ingredients for it right here. If you could go pick the fresh leaves of a Silkweed I can start to prepare the potion for you. It grows in my garden, just outside.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_NoChoice', 'Do you have another choice?', ''
'DL_Cendric_NoChoice', '...', '...'
'DL_Rhendal_SilkweedLocation', 'It grows in my garden, right in front of this house.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_DrinkThePotion', 'Very good. I just completed the other preparations. Now let''s add that Silkweed ... and, it''s done. You can drink it now.', ''
'DL_Choice_Okay', 'Okay...', ''
'DL_Choice_But', 'But...', ''
'DL_Rhendal_NoBut', 'No "but"! You want to get your memories back, don''t you.', ''
'DL_Cendric_OkayThen', '... Okay then.', ''
'DL_Choice_IGotStaff', 'I got the Hawthorn staff.', ''
'DL_Choice_WhatDoesThatMean', 'A mage... What does that mean?', ''
'DL_Choice_WhatJob', 'What job can you offer?', ''
'DL_Choice_HowCanIHelp', 'Okay, how can I help you?', ''
'DL_Choice_WhatAboutTheMark', 'About that mark on my wrist...', ''
'DL_Rhendal_NiceVision', '(Smiles) It seems that your vision was of use. I''ve never seen a guest of mine freeze my water before.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_SoYoureAMage', 'So you''re a mage. I''ve felt that you have a strong magic aura the first time you walked through that door.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_MageIs', 'It means that you are able to focus the magic energy that flows through this world and use it to your favour.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_MagiciansAre', 'It''s a special gift - not all people in Admantris have it.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_YouCanRead', 'And even if I''m not able to use that power myself, I still take an interest in the art of magic. You should definitely take a look into my book I wrote about it, its right next to the fireplace.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_YouHaveTo', 'But, what''s more important at the moment, is that you have to get to know your powers. What insights did the vision bring you?', ''
'DL_Choice_IHadStaff', 'I once had a staff and a fancy hat.', ''
'DL_Choice_ICanFreeze', 'I can apparently freeze water.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_YouHadStaff', 'Yes, that''s what some mages wear. But we saw you are a mage that is able to use ice magic.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_AndThisIsGood', 'And that''s exactly what I was looking for. I can offer you a job, if you''re interested.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_LetMeSee', 'Hmm, let me see... Interesting. It seems like the potion has not only brought you back some memories, but has also revealed this mark.', ''
'DL_Choice_SideEffect', 'It is not some side-effect of the potion?', ''
'DL_Choice_DoYouKnowAnything', 'Do you know anything about this mark?', ''
'DL_Rhendal_SideEffect', 'No, the Silkweed potion doesn''t create this kind of marks. It only reveals what''s hidden.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_TheMark', 'I don''t recognize the symbol... it''s definitely magic but doesn''t have a friendly aura, no, not at all...', ''
'DL_Rhendal_Curse', 'I think it''s some kind of curse, and it''s getting stronger. You''d be better off with finding someone that can break it. I have no knowledge about this kind of magic, I''m sorry.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_YouNeedAStaff', 'Before you can take this job, you need a staff to control and focus your magic. I grow a magical Hawthorn tree in my garden. Take a branch from this tree and you will have what you need.', ''
'DL_Cendric_IAlreadyHave', 'Erm... I think I...', ''
'DL_Rhendal_YouAlreadyHave', 'Ah, I see, you already took a branch. Well, I won''t be angry with you, but the next person from which you take things probably won''t be that lenient... ', ''
'DL_Rhendal_YouHaveStaff', 'It suits you well.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_OurProblem', 'The only way between our village and the tavern leads over the bridge in the West. The innkeeper brews a special kind of schnapps which I need for one of my potions.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_BrokenBridge', 'Unfortunately, that bridge has broken lately and it will take us some days to rebuild it.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_YourJob', 'Your job would be to get to the other side of the river by freezing a small passage, and get me a bottle of this schnapps from the tavern.', ''
'DL_Choice_IWillHelp', 'Okay, I''ll see what I can do.', ''
'DL_Choice_WhatsInIt', 'So, what''s in it for me then?', ''
'DL_Choice_IWontHelp', 'I don''t think I should waste my power like this...', ''
'DL_Rhendal_BrokenBridgeQuest', 'Great. Just ask the innkeeper for a "Feudal Fire", he''ll know what you want. And take these coins, it should be enough.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_YouAreEvil', 'And I don''t think you''ll get on the right way like this, boy.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_WhyYouShould', 'Well, you''d prove that you plan to use your power for greater good. I''m sure that one or two people may be pleased to hear about your good deed.', ''
'DL_Choice_IGotSchnapps', 'I got the schnapps for you.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_ThankForSchnaps', 'Oh, perfect, thank you. So you managed to cross the river. Hmm, a truly special drink. Do you want some? ', ''
'DL_Choice_IWantDrink', 'Yes, why not.', ''
'DL_Choice_IDontWantDrink', 'No, thank you.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_GivesSchnapps', 'Yes, that''s the right decision. Here, take a glass.', ''
'DL_Cendric_Thanks', 'Thanks.', ''
'DL_Choice_IDrankSchnapps', 'I got the schnapps for you... and it was delicious.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_NoSchnappsPity', 'Oh, what a pity. You don''t know what you''re missing.', ''
'DL_Choice_IGotSchnappsAnyway', 'I''ve changed my decision and brought you some schnapps - for free.', ''
'DL_Rhendal_YouDrankSchnaps', 'What? Oh you silly boy! You drank it yourself? You''re not the sharpest knife in the drawer, are you?!', ''
