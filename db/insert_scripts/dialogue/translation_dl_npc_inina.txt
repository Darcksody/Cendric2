'DL_Inina_MissingPaladin1', 'Yes, maybe you could help us. The name of the paladin I sent into the cave is Marcus.', ''
'DL_Inina_MissingPaladin2', 'He has taken my pendant with him. A special pendant that holds some divine energy and shines in the dark, so you should be able to find him.', ''
'DL_Inina_MissingPaladin3', 'You''d better take something with you as well that lights your way. I cannot accompany you, as I''m still trying to purify the magic of the shrine.', ''
'DL_Inina_Farmers', 'There were some incidents where people left the city and didn''t return. We have to tackle this problem first before we take care of some missing sheep.', ''
'DL_Inina_MissingPeople', 'We suspect that these incidents are connected to the strange magical energy we are observing here. But this has yet to be confirmed.', ''
'DL_Inina_Mage', 'The Eternal Light is well-disposed towards you. You have a very special aura. (Frowns) Although... something seems to be wrong with you. I feel a slight disturbance in your magic.', ''

'DL_Inina_WhereSearch', 'He went westward to a cave.', ''
'DL_Inina_WhatsInForMe', 'Well, as you''re a mage, I can teach you the path of the Eternal Light. You''ll never need to use a torch again. (Smiles)', ''
'DL_Inina_FoundPaladin', 'Oh no. That''s terrible. He was a good man. I''m going to pray for him. Thank you for bringing my pendant back.', ''
'DL_Inina_FoundPaladin2', 'We really need to find out what''s behind all this.', ''
'DL_Inina_LearnLight1', 'Yes, you''ve proven yourself worthy to learn the way of the Eternal Light.', ''
'DL_Inina_LearnLight2', 'To create a magical light, you''ll need a weapon that is capable of focusing divine magic. Then, concentrate the divine energy around you and let it shine.', ''
'DL_Inina_LearnLight3', 'Take this scroll. It will teach you everything you need to know.', ''
'DL_Inina_NoTeach', 'We can''t tell yet whether your heart is pure. You first have to prove that you are willing to help us.', ''
'DL_Choice_Mark', 'Maybe *this* influences my magic? (Show the mark)', ''
'DL_Inina_Mark', '(Flinches) By the Eternal Light! That''s a curse, and it doesn''t look good, no, not at all...', ''
'DL_Choice_WhatIsMark', 'Do you know what it is?', ''
'DL_Choice_MarkGetRid', 'Can you help me get rid of it?', ''
'DL_Choice_MarkWhoWould', 'Why would someone try to track me?', ''
'DL_Inina_WhatIsMark', 'Unless I am very much mistaken, this is a curse designed to track you.', ''
'DL_Inina_MarkGetRid', 'May I? (She places her finger on the mark but pulls it back instantly) No, that won''t work. I''m not familiar with this kind of magic.', ''
'DL_Inina_MarkGetRid2', 'If you really plan to get rid of that, ask the alchemist Syrah when you arrive in Gandria. She knows much more about curses than I do.', ''
'DL_Inina_MarkWhoWould', 'Well, the Paladins use a similar technique to mark and track down prisoners. But I''d know those marks. If you really don''t know why you bear it, you may be in trouble.', ''
'DL_Choice_IFoundNote', 'Paladin Marcus has carried this note with him... (Show note)', ''
'DL_Inina_FoundNote', 'Oh, thank you. Let me see... (Reads the note carefully)', ''
'DL_Inina_FoundNote2', 'It seems like he tried to write about a beast that transforms humans into wolves? Maybe that thing is also responsible for his strange aura here.', ''
'DL_Inina_FoundNote3', 'As you already got out of the cave alive, maybe you got a chance to hunt that beast down and slay it. I would offer you my undying gratitude and a great reward, of course.', ''
'DL_Choice_BeastSlain', 'I''ve slain the beast in the caverns.', ''
'DL_Inina_BeastSlain', 'Yes, I''ve already felt it. The evil magic that was obscuring the shrine is gone.', ''
'DL_Inina_BeastSlain2', 'You did us a great favour. Here, take this pouch filled with gold as a reward.', ''
'DL_Inina_BeastSlain3', 'I''m greatly impressed by your skills, mage. You may be a worthy initiant for the Clerics. (Takes a piece of paper and writes something down)', ''
'DL_Inina_BeastSlain4', 'Here, take this letter of recommendation with you and bring it to Commander Lloyd once you''re in the city, he is the leader of the Paladins.', ''
'DL_Inina_BeastSlain5', 'May the Eternal Light guide thee.', ''
